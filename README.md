## Motivation 

Imaging gadgets have permeated every aspect of contemporary life. They are ubiquitous in a variety of forms, including photography cameras, surveillance cameras, and mobile phones. Not only do these gadgets record the user's life digitally, but they also catch the lives of others around them. Individuals may feel uneasy about relinquishing control over their images, and there are major privacy problems associated with the widespread dissemination of private images and other information. Numerous face recognition systems have been developed to detect the facial area in a picture automatically. None of them, however, can attain 100% accuracy, particularly when the facial area has a very low resolution or the picture is of poor quality.
Thus, to provide privacy protection, it still needs human input from the user. For instance, Google Street View still needs human editing to completely obscure all of the passenger's faces.  

This project, willÂ develop an efficient and user-friendly software solution for masking people's faces in camera video streams. The following information pertain to this software prototype:
